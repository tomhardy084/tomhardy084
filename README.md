Hello, my name is Tom, and I have an MSc degree in GIS and Remote Sensing obtained at Wageningen university and research (WUR).
In recent years, I have been working on various projects at the Laboratory of GIS and Remote Sensing, also part of the WUR.
These included projects related to remote sensing and precision farming.
Besides this, my research interests are also related to geography in general, ecology, sustainable agriculture and forestry, and their relation to public health.
My ambition is to keep working in research and educational projects within these interests and disciplines.

For questions, please feel free to contact me at tom.hardy@wur.nl.
