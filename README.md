Hello, my name is Tom, and I have an MSc degree in GIS and Remote Sensing obtained at Wageningen university and research.
In recent years, I have been working on various projects at the Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, part of Wageningen Universtity and Research.
These included projects related to remote sensing and precision farming.
Besides this, my research interests are als related to geography in general, ecology, sustainable agriculture and forestry, and their relation to public health.
My ambition is to keep working in research and educational projects within these interests and disciplines.

For questions, please feel free to contact me at tom.hardy@wur.nl.
